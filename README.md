# ESP 32 Deluminator

Welcome to the ESP 32 Deluminator project. The name is a reference to Dumbledor's light snatching deluminator from the harry potter series. We have 3 very specific goals in mind as it relates to this project.

* (1) Create an esp32 device that can carry out various wifi based attacks on our home network. Specifically one that specializes in collecting encrypted WPA2 PSKs and other packet logging / sniffing based attacks.
* (2) Explore the wifi 802.11 protocol and internal workings of this medium
* (3) Explore the HW and programming model of the ESP32

# Disclaimer

We do not support or condone the use of any attacks on non consenting parties. Please only do this on your own hardware or on systems that you have been given rights to attack.

# Usage

* Set up the esp-idf build env as we describe [here](https://github.com/tanner-johnson2718/PI_JTAG_DBGR/blob/master/writeups/Init_PI_JTAG_Test.md#esp-32-set-up). This also describes flashing of the device.
* The main interface for the system is the repl, which can be connected to via:
    * USB serial (`idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 monitor`) OR
    * REPL TCP server (`nc 192.168.4.1 421`) (these settings can be changed in the menuconfig)
    * Through the repl one can interface, start, stop, and configure the main components.
* Type `help` on the serial repl to see all possible commands
* Documentation can be found in `main.c` and in every components header file.

## Typical Attack Flow

# Software

## Coding Standards

* (1) All component API functions **shall** return `esp_err_t`
    * Exceptions made for trivial situations like `is_running(void)` function
* (2) All returns from component API functions **shall** be handled via `ESP_ERROR_CHECK` or `ESP_ERROR_CHECK_WITHOUT_ABORT`
    * Again minus trivial exceptions, see note above
* (3) All components *should* have both implementation and theory doc in the header
* (4) All component API functions **shall** have a summary describing their execution logic, a description of their input args with possible values, and all possible return values and their meaning
    * While checking this its good to verify that the API function has appriopiatly strict check on input args and is returning error codes that are actually descriptive.
* (5) All component API functions **shall** start with the name of the component
    * Abbreviations are allowed i.e. `ui_init` for the user interface components
* (6) Completely Static memory i.e. no malloc and esp structures allocated statically or destroyed within the scope they were created. Check this off only once the module has undergone rigorious memory testing.
* (7) All config should be exported via a Kconfig param

## JTAG, GDB, and Perf / Mem Profiling

# 3D printed Case for v0.2+ (NO UI)

# Wiring and 3D Printed Case for v0.1 LCD version

Our initial prototypa had an lcd and rotary encoder. The code for this is archived at tag v0.1, but we found that 1 it was bulky and 2 it was easier to run the system from the repl. 

| ESP Pin | LCD / ROT Pin | Func |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 26 | SCL | SCL |
| 25 | SDA | SDA |
| Vin | LCD+ | Vin |
| GND | LCD- | GND |
| 33 | Rot Switch | Button Pin |
| GND | Rot Switch | Button Pin GND |
| 32 | Rot A Term | - |
| 27 | Rot B Term | - |
| GND | Rot Middle term | - |
| 3.3v | Rot Vin | - |

## TODO
* move eapol to it own modual
* 802.11 data pkt parsing
* wsl bypassser into auto deauth agent
* look into exactly what is happining when we crack
    * maybe make a python script for that
    * Only store pertinent eapol info
    * How do we decrypt traffic on a net
* IP Logger
* 3D printed case
* Mem and Perf analysis
* Readme
* Typical Attack Flow
