# ESP 32 Deluminator

Welcome to the ESP 32 Deluminator project. The name is a reference to Dumbledor's light snatching deluminator from the harry potter series. We have 3 very specific goals in mind as it relates to this project.

* (1) Create an esp32 device that can carry out various wifi based attacks on our home network. Specifically one that specializes in collecting encrypted WPA2 PSKs and other packet logging / sniffing based attacks.
* (2) Explore the wifi 802.11 protocol and internal workings of this medium
* (3) Explore the HW and programming model of the ESP32

# Disclaimer

We do not support or condone the use of any attacks on non consenting parties. Please only do this on your own hardware or on systems that you have been given rights to attack.

# Usage

* Set up the esp-idf build env as we describe [here](https://github.com/tanner-johnson2718/PI_JTAG_DBGR/blob/master/writeups/Init_PI_JTAG_Test.md#esp-32-set-up). This also describes flashing of the device.
* The main interface for the system is the repl, which can be connected to via:
    * USB serial (`idf.py -p /dev/ttyUSB0 monitor`) OR
    * REPL TCP server (`nc 192.168.4.1 421`) (these settings can be changed in the menuconfig)
* Through the repl one can interface, start, stop, and configure the main components.
* Type `help` on the repl to see all possible commands
    * When using REPL TCP server type `help_net`
* **NOTE** many of the components require putting the wifi driver in promiscious mode which if a client is connected will crash the system.
    * When connecting to access point these will be automatically stoppped
    * We have delayed launched functions that will launch these afte a delay so you can disconnect from the device.

## Typical Attack Flow

# Software and the ESP32 System

The main software desgin is event driven and based on free RTOS queues. `main.c` inits all the important esp systems such as wifi, flash memory, etc. It also inits all our main components. Each component is well documented and has a well documented API. `main.c` has a current high level overview of the system and is a good place to start. Each component then exports an API that can be called via the repl commands registered in main. For each component refer to its header file for documentation.However, most components can be summarized with the following model: 

```
                   call             push     recv             call
ESP API Call back -----> Publisher -----> Q ------> Consumer ------> ESP API

```

Publishers registers hooks with the with the ESP API i.e. a call back to be called when a packet hits the WIFI driver. Publishers do not usually have their own thread / task context, their functions are registered and called by esp system threads. Producers push events to RTOS queues which are waited on by consumers. Consumers get their own task. This allows us to priotize tasks based on importance of execution. Consumers usually then call into the ESP API either to log events or to write to disk or send a packet over the net, etc.

## Coding Standards

* (1) All component API functions **shall** return `esp_err_t`
    * Exceptions made for trivial situations like `is_running(void)` function
* (2) All returns from component API functions **shall** be handled via `ESP_ERROR_CHECK` or `ESP_ERROR_CHECK_WITHOUT_ABORT`
    * Again minus trivial exceptions, see note above
* (3) All components *should* have both implementation and theory doc in the header
* (4) All component API functions **shall** have a summary describing their execution logic, a description of their input args with possible values, and all possible return values and their meaning
    * While checking this its good to verify that the API function has appriopiatly strict check on input args and is returning error codes that are actually descriptive.
* (5) All component API functions **shall** start with the name of the component
    * Abbreviations are allowed i.e. `ui_init` for the user interface components
* (6) All components *should* use Kconfig params to set defines within their module
* (7) Completely Static memory i.e. no malloc and esp structures allocated statically or destroyed within the scope they were created. Check this off only once the module has undergone rigorious memory testing.

## JTAG and running GDB

# 3D printed Case for v0.2+ (NO UI)

# Wiring and 3D Printed Case for v0.1 LCD version

Our initial prototypa had an lcd and rotary encoder. The code for this is archived at tag v0.1, but we found that 1 it was bulky and 2 it was easier to run the system from the repl. 

| ESP Pin | LCD / ROT Pin | Func |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 26 | SCL | SCL |
| 25 | SDA | SDA |
| Vin | LCD+ | Vin |
| GND | LCD- | GND |
| 33 | Rot Switch | Button Pin |
| GND | Rot Switch | Button Pin GND |
| 32 | Rot A Term | - |
| 27 | Rot B Term | - |
| GND | Rot Middle term | - |
| 3.3v | Rot Vin | - |
