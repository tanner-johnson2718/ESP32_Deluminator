# ESP 32 Deluminator

Welcome to the ESP 32 Deluminator project. The name is a reference to Dumbledor's light snatching deluminator from the harry potter series. We have 3 very specific goals in mind as it relates to this project.

* (1) Create an esp32 device that can carry out various wifi based attacks on our home network. Specifically one that specializes in collecting encrypted WPA2 PSKs and other packet logging / sniffing based activites.
* (2) Explore the wifi 802.11 protocol and internal workings of this medium
* (3) Explore the HW and programming model of the ESP32

# Disclaimer

We do not support or condone the use of any attacks on non consenting parties. Please only do this on your own hardware or on systems that you have been given rights to attack.

# Software and the ESP32 System

* Set up the esp-idf build env as we describe [here](https://github.com/tanner-johnson2718/PI_JTAG_DBGR/blob/master/writeups/Init_PI_JTAG_Test.md#esp-32-set-up)
    * This page also describes how to set up JTAG debugging with a Raspberry Pi 4 model B. This is recommended if one does any ESP 32 development as it gives one intruction level stepping with a 45 dollar Raspberri PI.
* The block diagram below gives a good high level overview of the software components of this system:

```    
|-------------------|                   |--------------------|
|         UI        |                   | EAPOL | MAC Logger | 
|-------------------|    |-----------|  |--------------------|  |------------|
| Rotary Enc. | LCD |    | File Serv |  |      PKT Sniff     |  | WSL ByPass |
|-------------------|    |-----------|  |--------------------|  |------------|

|---------------------------------|   |---------------------------------------|
|              Main               |   |      LCD Attack / Util UI Apps        |
|---------------------------------|   |---------------------------------------|
| NVS | SPIFFS | REPL | STA | AP  |
|---------------------------------|
```

* Every module contains "self-contained" documentation. main.c is a good place to start to get a high level overview. Effort was made to make the components self contained and to provide both theory and implementation (what and why and how).
* The basic model is that of event driven services. Main inits all the important esp API systems. We then register our code as services that listen for certtain events on the system and act accordingly.

## TODO
* Finish the table below
    * DOC
* look into exactly what is happining when we crack
    * maybe make a python script for that 
* Recreate the LCD Apps in their own file
    * WPA2 Key Collecter
        * Targeted    - Send one to a specific
        * Aggresive   - For every ssid w/ stations send deauths on a timer till you get it
* Push attacks doc to component headers
* Deauthg repl
* REPL clear FS

### v0.2
* IP Logger
* Check if a network has PMF
* power analysis
* The way we save eapol keys and the way the way the tcp server work is jank
* EAPOL logger may have issues if multiple come in or only partial come in
* Make AP hidden
* Memory and Perfomance Analysis
* Pipe repl traffic over the AP?


## Coding Standards

* (1) All component API functions **shall** return `esp_err_t`
    * Exceptions made for trivial situations like `is_running(void)` function
* (2) All returns from component API functions **shall** be handled via `ESP_ERROR_CHECK` or `ESP_ERROR_CHECK_WITHOUT_ABORT`
    * Again minus trivial exceptions, see note above
* (3) All components *should* have both implementation and theory doc in the header
* (4) All component API functions **shall** have a summary describing their execution logic, a description of their input args with possible values, and all possible return values and their meaning
    * While checking this its good to verify that the API function has appriopiatly strict check on input args and is returning error codes that are actually descriptive.
* (5) All components *should* export a REPL test interface and this is the only context in which printf is allowed
* (6) All component API functions **shall** start with the name of the component
    * Abbreviations are allowed i.e. `ui_init` for the user interface components
* (7) All components *should* use Kconfig params to set defines within their module
* (8) Completely Static memory i.e. no malloc and esp structures allocated statically or destroyed within the scope they were created. Check this off only once the module has undergone rigorious memory testing.

* Rotary encoder - We used a random one we found but should be interoperable with any
