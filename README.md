# ESP 32 Deluminator

Welcome to the ESP 32 Deluminator project. We have 3 very specific goals in mind as it relates to this project.

* (1) Create an esp32 device that can carry out various wifi based attacks on our home network. Specifically one that specializes in collecting encrypted WPA2 PSKs.
* (1) Explore the wifi 802.11 protocol and internal workings of this medium
* (2) Explore the HW and programming model of the ESP32

# Disclaimer

We do not support or condone the use of any attacks on non consenting parties. Please only do this on your own hardware or on systems that you have been given rights to attack.

# HW / SW Requiements

* Set up the esp-idf build env as we describe [here]https://github.com/tanner-johnson2718/PI_JTAG_DBGR/blob/master/writeups/Init_PI_JTAG_Test.md#esp-32-set-up
    * This page also describes how to set up JTAG debugging with a Raspberry Pi 4 model B. This is recommended as it give one intruction level stepping.
* ESP32 Wroom Dev Kit
* LCD 2004 w/ i2c backpack
* Rotary encoder
    * We used a random one we found without the built in capacitors and dupont jumpers with no issue
* Any Random Battery Pack
    * Although our 3D printed case obviously only works with the links
