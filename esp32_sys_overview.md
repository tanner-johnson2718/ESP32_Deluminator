# ESP 32 Deluminator System Overview

* Start with `system/console/basic/example` to give us an interactive starting point
* Build, flash, and use USB UART as described [here](https://github.com/tanner-johnson2718/PI_JTAG_DBGR/blob/master/writeups/Init_PI_JTAG_Test.md#esp-32-set-up)
* This document will describe the key esp32 systems concepts used by this project
* And in particular will serve as the high level design doc for the coding and systems aspect of the ESP 32 Deluminator
* The build and src location is here [esp32_build](../esp32_build/)

# Flash Memory

## NVS

* Basically just allows one to store key-value pairs in a dedicated namespace
* Usage is as follows:

```C
#include "nvs_flash.h"
#include "nvs.h"

// MAKE SURE TO CHECK ERRORS, this is for brevity
nvs_flash_init();
nvs_open("ns", NVS_READWRITE, &my_handle);
nvs_set_i32(my_handle, "key", val);
nvs_get_i32(my_handle, "key", &val);
```

## File systems on Flash Memory

* Tried using FAT FS but it got corrupted rather quickly
* Using SPIFFS which does not allow dir

```C
#include "esp_spiffs.h"

// Easy mounting helper to mount fs
esp_vfs_spiffs_register(&config);
esp_spiffs_check(config.partition_label);
esp_spiffs_info(conf.partition_label, &total, &used);
esp_vfs_spiffs_unregister(conf.partition_label);

// Now the vfs gives POSIX complient like read, write, open, close and delete
FILE* f = fopen("/spiffs/hello.txt", "w");
fgets(line, sizeof(line), f); fread(...);
fwrite(...);
remove(path);
fclose(f);
```

# Event Loop API

The event loop API is a built in message passing async system built into the esp 32 dev env. There are two main subsytems:

* User defined - make your own event loop
* Default - creation and deletion hidden, used by WIFI API and you can use it to.

The basic API is shown below for the default event loop but the semantics hold for user defined ones

```C
#include "esp_event.h"

// Unclear what exactly the default settings are (define in the esp_event_loop_args_t struct)
// But these bad bois create and clean up the default event loop
esp_event_loop_create_default();
esp_event_loop_delete_default();

// Define a base to identify your class of events. Define an enum to map event_ids to enumerators
ESP_EVENT_DECLARE_BASE(MY_EVENT_BASE);
enum {                                       
    ID0;
    ID1;
};

// Here we can define a cb to be called when an event happens. Note we have macros for
// all event bases and/or all event ids.
void func(void* handler_args, esp_event_base_t base, int32_t id, void* event_data);
esp_event_handler_register(MY_EVENT_BASE, ID, func, arg);

// Now we can post events (even in an ISR context)
esp_event_post(MY_EVENT_BASE, ID, const void *event_data, size_t event_data_size, TickType_t ticks_to_wait);

// Use this with CONFIG_ESP_EVENT_LOOP_PROFILING enabled
esp_event_dump(FILE *file);
```

* [Event Loop API](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/system/esp_event.html)]
* Note Event loop appears to only dispatch one thread to process events
* Meaning an event handler need not handle reentrant cases cause it will never reenter 

# Push button with Debouncing

* Connct D13 to grount through button with 20kohm resitor
    * [D13] <---> Res <---> Switch <---> GND
* Configure the pin

```C
gpio_config_t gpio_conf = {};
gpio_conf.mode = GPIO_MODE_INPUT;
gpio_conf.pin_bit_mask = (1ULL << BUTTON_PIN);
gpio_conf.pull_up_en = 1;
gpio_conf.intr_type = GPIO_INTR_ANYEDGE;
gpio_config(&gpio_conf);
```

* Set up the ISR and a task to listen for events added by the ISR onto a queue
* We register an isr that uses in ISR context add to Q function.
* It adds whatever data was specified upon registry of the isr
    * usually an IO num to indicate which pin triggered the ISR
* Then we create a task that blocks until something is added to the queue

```C
static void IRAM_ATTR gpio_isr_handler(void* arg)
{
    uint32_t a = 0;

    // Copies frome &a to the Q the number bytes indicated upon Q creation
    xQueueSendFromISR(gpio_evt_queue, &a, NULL);
}

static void event_q_poller(void* arg)
{
    uint32_t io_num;
    for(;;)
    {
        if(xQueueReceive(gpio_evt_queue, &io_num, portMAX_DELAY)) {
            // process io event here
        }
    }
}

gpio_install_isr_service(0);
gpio_isr_handler_add(BUTTON_PIN, gpio_isr_handler, NULL);
gpio_evt_queue = xQueueCreate(10, sizeof(uint32_t));
xTaskCreate(event_q_poller, "event_q_poller", 2048, NULL, EVENT_QUEUE_PRIO, NULL);
```

# Generic ESP32 Systems Notes

## Early Start Up

* Bootstage 1
    * Reset vector code located in ROM and is unchangable
    * Based on type of reset certain registers dictate boot flow
    * In the usual case the 2nd stage boot loader is called from addr `0x1000`
    * Reads the Boot Loader header and loads 3 memory regions associated with the 2nd stage boot loader:
    * The passes control over to the loaded 2nd stage bootloader with entry at `0x4008_0688`

| Seg | Addr | Len | Target | Comment | 
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| .dram0.bss, .dram0.data, .dram0.rodata | `0x3FFF_0000` | `0x27FC` | Internal SRAM 1 | .dram0.bss is `0x30` in len and this seg is actually loaded at `0x3FFF_0030` |
| .iram_loader.text | `0x4007_8000` | `0x421B` | Internal SRAM 0 | - |
| .iram.text .iram.text | `0x4008_0400` | `0x10A1`| Internal SRAM 0 | - |

* Boot Stage 2
    * Maps First `0x1_0000` of flash to `0x3F40_0000`, mapping the partition table to `0x3F40_9000`
        * This makes sense why reading the virt addrs on the jtag only allowed us read the first `0x1_0000` bytes
    * Loads in the app image in accorance with the partition table and maps the following segments shown below
    * Remaps first `0x1_0000` bytes at addr `0x2_000` (the app) of flash to `0x3F40_0000`.
        * This maps over the part table mapping
        * Only maps `0x1_000` bytes to map the ro_data from the app image into the address space
    * Maps `0x4_0000` bytes starting at flash offset `0x3_0000` (this is `0x1_0000` bytes offset into the app.bin image) to vaddr `0x400D_0000`.
        * This mapping happens twice and both times we get a log message like this: `0x400d0020: _stext at ??:?`
        * Would need to look closer but my hypothesis is this is from the APP CPU, which in reset until app code starts, is getting pointed to this addr and this is where the messsage comes from
    * Finally it verifys the app image and uses the load addr contained in it to start the PRO CPU at address `0x4008_16DC` which is the function `call_start_cpu0`

* Application start up
    * Application code starts `call_start_cpu0` which is located at `esp-idf/components/esp_system/port/cpu_start.c`
        * This appears to do alot of early hardware init
        * This also starts the other core
        * Both cores end their init with the `SYS_STARTUP_FN` macro
    * Since we are in app code we can use gdb to peer into this start up code
        * todo this don't use the `idf.py gdb` call as it auto inserts a break point at app_main and continues after reset
        * Instead use the provided [gdb script](./gdb_start.sh)
    * cpu0 enters `start_cpu0()` in `startup.c`
        * cpu0 calls `do_core_init()` in `startup.c`
            * cpu0 calls `heap_caps_init()` in `heap/heap_caps_init.c`
                * heap init uses the `heap_memory_layout.h` API and global structs to find all the RAM regions such that it is not used by static data, used by ROM code, or reserved by a component using the `SOC_RESERVE_MEMORY_REGION()` macro.
                * It then condenses these memory regions down, each regions and allocates heaps metadat for that heap in that region.
            * `do_core_init` then does all sorts of init tasks: timers, secure boot verification, etc, etc.
        * cpu0 then calls `do_global_ctors` which allows functions added to the init array at build time to be ran. See [here](https://github.com/tanner-johnson2718/MEME_OS_3/tree/main/Loading) for details on init functions and their linking.
        * Finally it secondary init which passes control over to other cores so if they have init todo they may
    * cpu0 calls `esp_startup_start_app`
        * starts dameon tasks
        * starts "main task" pinned to cpu0
            * calls our app main
        * starts scheduler `vTaskStartScheduler();`
    * cpu1 started ite init late in cpu0's init.
    * cpu1 calls `esp_startup_start_app_other_cores`
        * starts dameon tasks
        * waits for scheduler on cpu0 to be finished
        * starts scheduler `xPortStartScheduler();`
